These scripts serve two primary functions:

- Core functions and events for general use across the entire Minecraft server
- The DERPI - or: DEMEANOR ERADICATION & REHABILITATION PENITENTIARY INSTITUTE - is a punishment system that works by confining undesirable players and behavior to a stone quarry, ensuring they earn their freedom back.

These scripts are powered by the natural language scripting engine [Skript](http://njol.ch/projects/skript/) by [Peter GÃ¼ttinger aka Njol](http://njol.ch/). This repository will be kept updated with code being run on the server.
